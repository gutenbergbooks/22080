<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>There is in Shropshire a fine oak-tree which the
country people there call the "Royal Oak". They
say it is the great-grandson, or perhaps the great-great-grandson
of another fine old oak, which more than two
hundred years ago stood on the same spot, and served once
as a shelter to an English king. This king was Charles II,
the son of the unlucky Charles I who had his head cut off
by his subjects because he was a weak and selfish ruler.</p>

<p>On the very day on which that unhappy king lost his
head, the Parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to make
his son, Prince Charles of Wales, or any other person, king
of England. But the Scottish people did not obey this law.
They persuaded the young prince to sign a paper, solemnly
promising to rule the country as they wished; then they
crowned him king. As soon as the Parliament heard of
this they sent Cromwell and his Ironsides against the newly-crowned
king and his followers, and after several battles
the Scottish army was at last broken up and scattered at
Worcester.</p>

<p>Charles fled and hid in a wood, where some poor
wood-cutters took care of him and helped him. He put on
some of their clothes, cut his hair short, and stained his face
and hands brown so that he might appear to be a sunburnt
workman like them. But it was some time before he
could escape from the wood, for Cromwell's soldiers were
searching it in the hope of finding some of the king's men.
One day, Charles and two of his friends had to climb into
the tall oak to avoid being caught. They had with them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
some food, which proved very useful, for they were obliged to
stay in their strange hiding-place for a whole day. The top
of the oak-tree had been cut off some few years before this
time, and this had made the lower branches grow thick and
bushy, so that people walking below could not easily see
through them. It was a fortunate thing for Charles, for
while he was in the tree, he heard the soldiers beating the
boughs and bushes in the wood as they searched here and
there, and even caught glimpses of them through the leaves
as they rode about below.</p>

<p>When they had gone, without even glancing up into
the tall oak-tree, he came down, and rode away from the
wood on an old mill-horse, with his friends the wood-cutters
walking beside him to take care of him as best they could.
The saddle was a poor one, and the horse's pace jolted
Charles so much, that at last he cried out that he had never
seen so bad a steed. At this the owner of the horse jestingly
told him that he should not find fault with the poor animal,
which had never before carried the weight of three kingdoms
upon its back. He meant, of course, that Charles was king
of the three kingdoms of England, and Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

<p>Carried by the old horse, and helped by the poor wood-cutters,
Charles at last reached the house of a friend. Here
he hid for a time, and then went on to try and escape from
the country. This time, so that he might not be discovered,
he was dressed as a servant, and rode on horseback, with
a lady sitting on a cushion behind him, as was then the
fashion. After several more dangers he managed to get on
board a ship and sailed away to France.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Charlie was the grandson of King James
II, who was driven away from the throne of England
because he was a selfish man and a bad ruler. The young
prince tried to win the crown back again. He came over
to Scotland from France, with only seven followers; but soon
a great many of the Scots joined him, for he was so gay, and
handsome, and friendly, that all who saw him loved him.
They called him "Bonnie Prince Charlie". But though
the prince and his followers were very brave, they had no
chance against the well-trained soldiers of King George of
England. They won a few victories; then they were
thoroughly beaten in the battle of Culloden. Thousands
of brave Scots were slain, and the prince had to fly for
his life.</p>

<p>After this, for many weeks, he hid among the moors and
mountains from the English soldiers who were trying to find
him. He lived in small huts, or in caves, and many times
had nothing but the wild berries from the woods to eat.
Once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers, who
were very kind to him; and though the king offered a large
sum of money to anyone who would give him up, not one
of his poor friends was false to him.</p>

<p>At last, a young and beautiful Scottish lady, named
Flora MacDonald, helped him to escape. She gave him
woman's clothes, and pretended that he was her servant,
called Betty Burke. Then she took him with her away
from the place where the soldiers were searching, and after
a time he reached the sea, and got safely away to France.</p>

<p>Lord Nelson was one of the greatest seamen that
ever lived. He commanded the British fleet at the
battle of Trafalgar, when the navies of France and Spain
were beaten, and England was saved from a great danger.
He did not look like a famous admiral on board his ship, the
<i>Victory</i>, that day. He was a small man, and his clothes
were shabby. He had lost one arm and one eye in battle;
but with the eye which remained he could see more than
most men with two, and his brain was busy planning the
course of the coming fight. Just before it began, he went over
his ship, giving orders to the crew, and cheering them with
kind words, which touched the hearts of the rough men, who
loved their leader and were proud of him. "England expects
every man to do his duty" was the last message he sent them.
Every man did his duty nobly that day, though the battle
was fierce and long; but it was the last fight of the brave
commander. He was shot in the back as he walked the
deck with his friend Captain Hardy, and was carried below.</p>

<p>He lay dying for several hours, but, in spite of his great
pain, his one thought was of the battle. "How goes the
day with us?" he asked of Hardy; and when told that many
of the enemies' ships were taken, he cried eagerly, "I am
glad. Whip them, Hardy, as they have never been whipped
before." Later, when his friend came to tell him that the
victory was won, Nelson pressed his hand. "Good-bye,
Hardy!" said he, "I have done my duty, and I thank God
for it." These were the last words of one of England's
bravest sons.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>There was once a little Scotch boy named James
Watt. He was not a strong child, and could not
always run and play with other boys, but had often to
amuse himself at home. One holiday afternoon little James
amused himself in this way. He held a saucer over the
stream of steam which came from the spout of a boiling
kettle, and as he watched he saw little drops of water
forming on the saucer. He thought this was very strange,
and wondered why it happened, for he did not know that
steam is just water changed in form by the heat, and that as
soon as it touches something cold it turns again into water.
He asked his aunt to explain it, but she only told him not to
waste his time. If she could have foreseen the work which
her nephew would do when he became a man, she would
not have thought he was wasting his time.</p>

<p>When James Watt grew up, he was as much interested
in steam and its wonderful power, as he had been as a boy.
He was sure it could be made of great service to men. It was
already used for driving engines, but the engines were not
good, and it cost much money to work them. Watt thought
they could be improved, but it was long before he found out
the way to do this. Often, he sat by the fire watching the
lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam, and
thinking of many plans; and at last a happy thought came
to him. His plan enabled great improvements to be made
in the working of engines, and now steam drives our trains
and ships, our mills and factories, and is one of our most
useful servants.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria was always proud of her brave
soldiers. In time of war, she gave orders that news
of them was to be sent to her every day, and when the
generals returned home, they were commanded to visit her,
and to tell her of the bravery of the troops.</p>

<p>During the long war with the Russians in the Crimea,
the British soldiers suffered greatly from the freezing winds,
and rain, and snow, of that cold land. When Queen
Victoria heard of this, she and her children worked with
their own hands to make warm clothing for them. A great
many of the wounded and sick men were sent home in ships,
to be nursed in the English hospitals, and the Queen paid
several visits to the poor fellows as they lay there. Moving
from one bed to another, she cheered them with hopeful
words, and listened gladly to their stories of the battles in
which they had fought. When she saw that the hospitals
were crowded, and not very comfortable, she told Parliament
that better ones ought to be provided, and after a time this
was done, and the fine hospital of Netley was built, of which
the Queen laid the first stone.</p>

<p>Once, Queen Victoria herself gave medals to some
wounded and disabled soldiers who had fought very bravely.
Some of these men could not raise their arms to salute their
queen; some could not walk, but had to be wheeled in chairs
to her side; but all were proud to receive their medals of
honour from her hands.</p>

<p>"Noble fellows," she wrote of them afterwards, "I feel
as if they were my own children."</p>

<p>During the time of the terrible Indian Mutiny, when
most of the native troops rose against their British
rulers, and vowed to kill every white person in the land,
many cruel deeds were done. A great number of white
people were slain before the British troops could come to
their rescue, but in some places they managed to hold out
until help reached them. This was the case in the city of
Lucknow, where the British governor with a small body
of troops, and a great many women and children, took refuge
in the Government House from a vast host of rebels who
came to attack them. Many of the brave defenders were
killed by the shot and shell of the enemy. Many others,
and especially the little children, fell sick and died, for the
heat was very great, and there was no good water to be
had. Then, after many days, a small body of white
soldiers fought their way into the city, and brought help and
hope to the rest of the party. They were only just in time.
Had they come a few days later they would have found the
Government House a heap of ruins, and their friends dead,
for the rebels were making a mine under the building and
meant to blow it up with gunpowder. But alas! the newcomers
were not strong enough to fight their way out of
Lucknow with a crowd of helpless women and children and
sick folk, so they, too were now shut in. For two months
longer they held out. Then at last, when they had almost lost
hope, the great Sir Colin Campbell with his brave Highlanders
and other soldiers defeated the rebels, and brought the band
of sick, starving, and weary people safely away.</p>

<p>On a small rocky island, off the north coast of England,
there is a lighthouse. A man named William Darling
was once keeper of this lighthouse, and his daughter Grace
lived with him. Every day Grace Darling helped her father
to trim the lamps, so that at night they might shine brightly,
and warn sailors to steer their ships away from the dangerous
rocks, upon which they would have been dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>One stormy night Grace woke with the sound of screams
in her ears. The screams came from the sea, so she knew
that some ship must be in distress. She roused her father,
but they could see nothing in the darkness. When daylight
came, they found that a ship had been wrecked upon the
rocks some way off, and a few people were clinging to the
masts. Grace wished to go at once in a boat to save them;
but at first her father hung back, for the wind and sea were
wild, and he feared that the small boat would be overturned
by the great waves. Then Grace ran to the boat, and seized
an oar, for she could not bear to let the poor men die without
trying to save them; and the father could not let his brave,
daughter go alone, so he followed, and they rowed off.</p>

<p>It was hard work pulling against the strong sea, and
several times the small boat was almost sunk. But at last
it reached the wreck, and William Darling managed to land
upon the rock, and with great care and skill helped the
half-frozen people into the small boat. Then they were
taken to the lighthouse, where Grace warmed and fed
them, until the storm ceased, and they could return to their
homes.</p>

<p>At one time many people believed that the middle of Africa
was a sandy desert, where nothing could live but camels
and ostriches. But they were mistaken. The great traveller,
David Livingstone, journeyed into this unknown country, and
he found that it was not a desert but a beautiful land, where
many tribes of black people dwelt. He also saw that these
people were often seized by strangers, and taken away to be
sold as slaves. This sight filled him with sadness, and he
made up his mind to put a stop to this cruel traffic. He
worked hard, tracing the courses of the rivers, finding the
best tracts of land, and teaching the natives. Then he urged
his countrymen to send others after him to settle in this fair
country, to help the natives to learn useful trades, and to
drive away the slave-merchants.</p>

<p>For some years he was quite alone, with his black servants,
in the midst of this wild land. His friends grew anxious,
and sent Mr. Stanley, another great traveller, to look for
him. Stanley marched for nearly a year before he found
Livingstone. The old explorer was white and worn with
sickness and hardship, and he was overjoyed to clasp once
more the hand of a white man, and to hear again the English
tongue. But he would not return to England. He said
his work was not yet done, and he set out once more on his
travels. It was his last journey. One morning his servants
found him dead upon his bed. Since that time much has
been done to make Central Africa a prosperous land. Other
white men have followed where Livingstone led, and wherever
they have settled, the wicked slave-trade has been stopped.</p>

<p>Fields of waving corn, green woods, fruitful orchards,
a pretty farmhouse and a few cottages&mdash;such was the
plain of Waterloo. And there, on a summer Sunday,
nearly a hundred years ago, was fought a famous battle, in
which the British troops under the Duke of Wellington
beat the French army, and broke the power of the great
Napoleon for ever.</p>

<p>"We have them," cried Napoleon as he saw the British
drawn up before him. He thought it would be easy to
destroy this army, so much smaller than his own, before
their friends the Prussians, who were on the way to help
them, came up. But he was mistaken. Wellington had
placed his foot-soldiers in squares, and though the French
horsemen, then the finest soldiers in the world, charged
again and again, these little clumps of brave men stood
fast. On his favourite horse "Copenhagen", Wellington
rode to and fro cheering his men. "Stand firm, my lads,"
cried he. "What will they say to this in England?"</p>

<p>Not till evening, when the Prussians came, would he
allow them to charge the French in their turn. Then,
waving his cocked hat over his head, he gave the order,
"The whole line will advance", and the impatient troops
dashed forward. The French bravely tried to stand against
this terrific charge, but they were beaten back, and the battle
of Waterloo was ended.</p>

<p>Sixty thousand men lay dead or wounded under the fruit-trees,
and among the trampled corn and grass at the end of
that terrible day.</p>

<p>Forward the Light!</p>

<p>Such was the order given during a great battle to
the leader of a band of six hundred British soldiers.
Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready
to shoot them down as they came, while on the hills on
either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the
Russians.</p>

<p>"Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent
to certain death," thought the leader of the Light Brigade.</p>

<p>"Forward! Attack!"</p>

<p>The order was repeated, and with the obedience of well-trained
soldiers the Brigade started.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Theirs not to make reply,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.4em;">Theirs not to reason why,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.4em;">Theirs but to do and die:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.4em;">Into the valley of Death</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.4em;">Rode the six hundred."</span></p>

<p>On every side thundered the enemy's guns, and shot
and shell fell thick and fast, but on through all rode the
brave horsemen, on till they reached the cannon at the end
of the valley. The smoke of the enemy's fire closed round
and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and
again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those
who tried to stop their charge.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Flashed all their sabres bare,<br /></span>

<p>And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed,
when their duty had been nobly done in the face of death,

back. Alas! there were not then six hundred. Barely two
hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke and
powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble

<p>Never had a country a more popular king than
King Edward VII, nor a more gracious queen than
Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the
English people than that on which King Edward was
crowned. A few days before the date fixed for the Coronation
the king suddenly became ill, and a great gloom fell over the
country, for it was feared that he might never be crowned.
But though his illness was severe he soon began to get better,
and when he was out of danger the hearts of his subjects were
filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells
pealed, and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the
happy crowds which lined the streets of London, through
which the king and queen, in the midst of their gay
procession, drove to Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant
gatherings the world has ever seen. Princes and princesses
from other lands were there, in their robes of state; peers and
peeresses, in velvet, and ermine, and glittering diamonds;
grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay uniforms.</p>

<p>It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all,
the aged Archbishop of Canterbury drew near to the King,
and with trembling hands placed the crown upon his head.</p>

<p>"The Lord give you a fruitful country, and healthful
seasons, victorious fleets and armies, and a quiet Empire."
These are the words that the old man said when he had
crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that all
these blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII,
and the great Empire over which he rules.</p>

<p>May 31st, 1889, is a day that will long be remembered with
horror by the people in the beautiful valley of the Conemaugh,
in Pennsylvania. On that date occurred the
terrible disaster which is known to the world and will be named in
history as the "Johnstown Flood."</p><br />

<p class="caption">SAVED FROM THE FLOOD.</p><br />

<p>For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard,
and great floods extended over a vast region of country in Pennsylvania,
New York and the District of Columbia. Never before had
there been such a fall of rain in that region within the memory of
the oldest inhabitant. The waters in the river and creeks of that
beautiful valley rose rapidly and overflowed their banks, while the
people looked on in wonder, but seemingly not in fear. Suddenly
there appeared to their wondering gaze a great bay horse galloping
at break-neck speed and bearing a rider who waved his hands to them
and cried: "South Fork dam will burst. To the hills for your lives."
Only a few heeded his words of warning, while many mocked and
jeered. On dashed the rider to warn still others of the impending
danger, and, alas, to be himself and horse dashed to death by the massive
timbers of a falling bridge. South Fork dam did break, and the
mighty waters of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force
upon the doomed people of that beautiful valley. The terrible details
of the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than this. On
rushed the mighty waters, sweeping onward in their flood dwellings,
churches and buildings of every description, whether of wood, brick or
stone, until Johnstown was reached and destroyed. The town was
literally lifted from its foundations. Thousands of men, women and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
children were caught up and swirled away in the pitiless flood, and their
agonizing but vain appeals for help could be heard amidst the mighty
roar of the waters. Many acts of heroism were performed by brave
men and women&mdash;yes, and boys&mdash;in rescuing victims of the flood.
Only one of them concerns us here. Charles Hepenthal, a schoolboy,
seventeen years of age, who was on his way to Bellefonte from his
home at East Liberty, Pa., on the evening of the flood, stood quietly
among the passengers on the express train, as they crowded to view
the terrible havoc done by the flood. As the flood reached the
train, at Sang Hollow, a small frame house came pitching down
the mad tide, an eddy floated it in, near to the train, so close that
the wailing cries of an infant were heard, piercing their way through
the roar. Charles Hepenthal's heart was touched and his courage
was equal to the emergency. He determined to rescue that little
wailing waif from a watery grave. Strong men urged him to desist,
insisting that he would only sacrifice his own life for nothing&mdash;that
it was impossible for any one to survive in the surging waters. But
the boy was resolved. He cut the bell cord from the cars, tied it
fast to his body, and out into the whirling gulf he went; he gained
the house, secured the infant and returned through the maddened
waters with the rescued babe in his arms. A shout went up from the
passengers on the train. "Wait!" he cried; "there is still another
in the house, I must save her!" and, seizing a plank to use as a support,
he plunged again into the surging waters. Ah! his struggle
this time was harder, for his precious load was heavy. In the floating
house on his first visit he found a little girl, apparently ten years old,
disrobed and kneeling beside her bed, on which lay the screaming
infant, praying to her Father in heaven to save her and her baby
brother from the fury of the flood. "God has heard my prayer," she
cried, as Charles entered the door. "Oh, save the baby, quick," and
then fainted away on the floor. When Charles had landed the babe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in safety and returned again for the girl, he found her still unconscious
on the floor, and the water was fast flowing in at the door. In
another minute she would have been drowned. But the brave boy's
manly arms were soon around her, and with his precious load the
young hero fought his way back to land and was given three times
three cheers and a "tiger" by the passengers of the day express.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument
had reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic
cat ascended the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and
tubing. When the workmen arrived at the upper landing the next
morning, and began to prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright
and, springing to the outer edge, took a "header" of 160 feet to the
hard earth below. In the descent which was watched closely by two
score of men, the cat spread herself out like a flying squirrel and
alighted on all fours. After turning over on the ground a few times
in a dazed manner, she prepared to leave the grounds and had gotten
almost beyond the shadow of the monument, when a dog belonging
to one of the workmen pounced upon her and killed her, she, of
course, not being in her best running trim, after performing such an
extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the body of the dead
feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the remains over to a
representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who mounted the skin
and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case tells this
wonderful story in a few words: "This cat on September 23, 1880,
jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Long ago, when this country was a wild land, there lived
a beautiful and brave queen named Boadicea.</p>

<p>Her husband, the king, was dead, but she had two
daughters whom she loved very much.</p>

<p>Boadicea was queen of a part of Britain. There were
no large towns in her land, but there were forests of fine
trees, and fields of corn, and wide stretches of grass-land
where many cattle and sheep roamed and fed.</p>

<p>Her people were called Iceni. They were tall and
strong, with blue eyes and yellow hair. The men were
brave fighters and good hunters. They hunted the bears
and wolves which lived in the forests, and they fought the
foes of their beautiful queen.</p>

<p>They made spears to fight with, and strange carts called
war-chariots to fight in. These chariots were drawn by
swift horses, and, upon the wheels, long sharp knives were
fixed. The Iceni drove the chariots very fast among their
foes, and the knives cut down and killed many of them.</p>

<p>The Romans from over the sea were the most dangerous
enemies of Boadicea and her people.</p>

<p>In those days the Romans were the best fighters, and
the strongest and wisest people in the world. They came in
ships to Britain. They had been told that it was a good
country, and they hoped to take it for themselves. Some
of them came to Boadicea's land, and took a part of it
and of her riches. And when she tried to stop them from
doing this, they seized her and the two princesses and beat
them cruelly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>This wicked act made the Iceni very angry. From all
parts of the land, fierce fighting-men came marching in haste
to avenge themselves on their enemies, bringing with them
their spears and their war-chariots. When all were gathered
together, they fell upon the Romans.</p>

<p>There were so many of them, and they were so fierce,
that the Romans could not stand against them. Thousands
were killed, and the rest ran away to their ships.</p>

<p>But there were many more Romans in other parts of
Britain, and when these heard how their friends had been
beaten, they came marching in haste to punish the Iceni.</p>

<p>The Iceni did their best to get ready to defend themselves,
but many of their brave men had been slain and others
were wounded and weary, so they could not hope again to
win a victory over their strong foes. Before the battle,
Queen Boadicea, with her fair hair waving in the wind,
stood before her soldiers and spoke to them. She told
them of the wrong which the Romans had done, and begged
them to fight bravely for their country. Then she got into
her chariot, and with her daughters lying at her feet, drove
to and fro, so that all might see them.</p>

<p>And the soldiers shouted, and promised to fight to the
end for their brave queen.</p>

<p>They did fight long and bravely, until most of them
were killed, but their foes were too strong for them. When
Queen Boadicea saw that her brave soldiers were beaten,
she drank some poison which killed her. She thought it
better to die than to be again taken prisoner by the cruel
Romans.</p>

<p>Once, when good King Alfred of England was forced
to flee from his strong foes the Danes, he hid himself
in a wood. In this wood, there was a small cottage, and
Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in
and rest.</p>

<p>Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw
that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired,
so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen.</p>

<p>Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking,
and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them,
and took care that they did not burn, she would give him
some supper. Then she went away to do her work.</p>

<p>At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when
they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the
fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and
of his poor people, and then he forgot his task.</p>

<p>When the woman came back, the cakes were black and
burnt. "You are an idle fellow," cried she angrily. "You
would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take
the trouble to watch them."</p>

<p>While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home.
He knew King Alfred. "Hush, wife!" cried he. "It is
our noble lord the king!"</p>

<p>When the woman heard this, she was much afraid, and
she begged Alfred to forgive her.</p>

<p>The king smiled, and said: "I will gladly forgive you
for your scolding, good wife, if you will forgive me for
spoiling your supper."</p>

<p>In old days the people of England were not all free, as
they are now. Sometimes young men, and women, and
little children were sold as slaves, and had to work hard
for their masters.</p>

<p>Many of these slaves were sent to Rome, for the Romans
thought the tall, fair Angles very beautiful, and liked to have
them as their servants.</p>

<p>Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was
walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw
a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought.
Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow
hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange
sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had
dark hair, and brown skin.</p>

<p>"Who are these boys?" asked he of a man who was
standing by.</p>

<p>"They are Angles from over the sea," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Surely not Angles, but Angels," said the preacher,
looking kindly into the boys' faces. "Do they come from
England?"</p>

<p>"From heathen England, where men do not know the
true God," said the man.</p>

<p>"Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then
indeed they shall be angels," said Gregory.</p>

<p>Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When
he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good
preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the
people there, and to teach them to be Christians.</p>

<p>When William of Normandy came over the sea, and
took the crown of England, many English people would
not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of
these. He and his men made for themselves a "Camp of
Refuge" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All
day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose
from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and
attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns.</p>

<p>Hereward was called "the Wake" because he was so
watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch
him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not
know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men
used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their
horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back.</p>

<p>But at last a false friend of the English showed them the
way to the "Camp of Refuge", and then Hereward had to
flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore,
and there he found some fishermen who were going
to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town.</p>

<p>The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their
boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail.
The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it
served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English
soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of
them before they could get their swords to defend themselves.
When the English people in the place saw this,
they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of
their town.</p>

<p>There was once a king of England, named Canute,
who was a brave and clever man. But he had many
lords in his court who were very foolish. They feared their
master, and wished to please him, and because they knew
that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness,
they thought he would like to be told that he was great,
and wise, and powerful.</p>

<p>So they praised him every day, and told him that all
he did and all he said was good. They said he was the
greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world
too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute
tired of their vain words.</p>

<p>One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore,
one of them told him that even the waves would obey him.</p>

<p>"Bring a chair," said Canute, "and place it close to the
water."</p>

<p>The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the
king sat down and spoke to the waves.</p>

<p>"I command you to come no farther," cried he.</p>

<p>But the waves came on and on, until they wetted
Canute's feet, and splashed his chair.</p>

<p>Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were
standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking
in low tones about his strange conduct.</p>

<p>"Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"
said he sternly. "No king is great and powerful but God.
He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come,
and no farther.'"</p>

<p>Many years ago, King Edward III of England took
the town of Calais from the French king. He could
not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he
succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round
the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take
food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited
bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they
knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they
would starve.</p>

<p>So the governor sent word to King Edward that he
would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on
the people.</p>

<p>But Edward was angry. "Tell your masters," said he
to the messenger, "that I will not spare the people unless
six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and
ropes around their necks."</p>

<p>At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud.
But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die
for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes
around their necks, they went out to the place where King
Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English
nobles.</p>

<p>"Great king!" said the men, "we bring you the keys
of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."</p>

<p>But the king would not listen. "Take them away and
cut off their heads," he cried angrily. And when his nobles
begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen
to them.</p><br />

<p>"My lord," she cried, "if you love me, give me the lives
of these men."</p>

<p>King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in
tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: "Lady, I
wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay.
Take the men, they are yours."</p>

<p>Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away,
and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to
their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were
saved.</p><br />

<p>In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are
free to go where they will, and to do what work they
please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer
people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to
work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to
move from one place to another without asking leave.</p>

<p>This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In
the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen
made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They
banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man
named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London.</p>

<p>The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up
the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they
forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they
rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke
open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the
palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed
none.</p>

<p>The nobles were much alarmed. With young King
Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army,
and to ask the people what they wanted.</p>

<p>"We want to be free, and we want our children to be
free after us," said Wat Tyler.</p>

<p>"I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will
return quietly to your homes," said the king.</p>

<p>At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have
been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand,
and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his
sword, and killed the leader of the people.</p>

<p>Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of
anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press
forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have
been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly
riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their
head. "What need ye, my masters?" cried he. "I am
your captain and your king. Follow me."</p>

<p>The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud
cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These
rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but
to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel.
They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and,
with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led;
and so for a time the danger was past.</p>

<p>Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary,
lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills.
His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding
from the English soldiers, who sought to take him&mdash;alive
or dead&mdash;to their king. The brave Scots had lost many
battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make
his dear country free.</p>

<p>"I will give up trying," said he.</p>

<p>Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave,
by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he
left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature
would do.</p>

<p>The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself
up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when
it slipped and fell to the end once more.</p>

<p>Again and again it started to climb, and again and again
it slipped back, until it had fallen six times.</p>

<p>"Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying
to climb so fine a thread," thought Bruce. But the spider
did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet
a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went,
inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the
roof, and was safely at home.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the king. "The spider has taught me a
lesson. I too will try until I win."</p>

<p>Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle,
again and again, until at last the English were driven back
to their own land, and Scotland was free.</p>

<p>In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King
of England. He had been with some other kings to a
great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and
taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him
Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in
fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him
into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out
for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings,
but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once.</p>

<p>Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men
praised King Richard, and this made some of the other
kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have
more honour than they. When he was on his way back to
England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and
threw him into prison.</p>

<p>And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could
he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved.
One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a
voice singing, beneath the window. He started. "Surely,"
said he, "that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and
that is the song we used to sing together." When the song
was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then
there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard
knew that it was indeed his friend.</p>

<p>Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost
master. Now he hastened to England, and told the
people where to find their king, and very soon Richard
was set free, and went back to his own land.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing,
when the <i>White Ship</i> set sail from the shore of France.
Prince William of England and his sister and their young
friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to
the French king.</p>

<p>The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had
sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But
the prince would not go with them, he wished to make
merry before starting.</p>

<p>There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and
singing on board the <i>White Ship</i>, and everyone was merry.</p>

<p>But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could
not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the
ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking.</p>

<p>Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of
fear. "Save us!" shrieked the terrified people. "Save the
prince," cried the captain, "the rest of us must die!" There
was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was
put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far,
when he heard his sister crying to him to save her.</p>

<p>"Go back!" shouted he. The boat was rowed back,
but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped
into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned.</p>

<p>Soon the <i>White Ship</i> sank also, and of all the gay
company upon it only one man was saved.</p>

<p>When King Henry heard that his only son was dead,
he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again
saw a smile upon his face.</p>

<p>In a village in the green country of France, there once
lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing
and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep.</p>

<p>At that time there was a sad war in France, and the
English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear
of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and
day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told
her to go and help the French prince.</p>

<p>When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed
at her.</p>

<p>"How can a poor girl help the prince?" asked they.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Joan; "but I must go, for God
has sent me." So she went to the prince, and said: "Sir,
my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win
the crown of France."</p>

<p>They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white
horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the
soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an
angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles.</p>

<p>Then the prince was crowned King of France.</p>

<p>When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over.
"I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with
my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see
me," pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So
Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she
was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to
death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name
will never be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling
adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls
upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to
such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human
beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher
grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that
I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence,
during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and
bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house,
situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water
mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he
was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the
hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close
at hand.</p>

<p>The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One
morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy
banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were;
but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of
the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing,
however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers
came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter
came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls
about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows
began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with
their cries and the noise of their rushing wings.</p><br />

<p class="caption">AFLOAT WITH A TIGERÂ°</p><br />

<p>While watching the immense destruction of these insects we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
startled by the outbreak of the thunderstorm high up on the
mountains, but far above the peals of thunder rose the terrible sound
of rushing water. Animals now came tearing out of the lowlands
too terrified to notice whither they went, so that I stood ready, gun
in hand, in case any of the dangerous kind should try to seek an
asylum on my particular hill; but with the exception of a huge wild
boar, who had to be shot as he charged up the slope, all took refuge
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Soon the water burst through the river bank, spreading over the
country, sweeping down the tall grass jungle and surging and roaring
round our hill. Packing all that was valuable in small parcels, we
gathered them in a heap, hoping that the flood would subside ere it
reached the building. All round about large trees, uprooted by the
terrible force of the deluge, were swept along, several animals vainly
trying to keep a footing among their roots and branches. At last the
water reached the steps of the house; so, pulling our boat close up,
we stepped in with what we could save and hung to the wooden posts
of the building, vainly trusting that the worst had come; but it was
not so, for we soon had to leave go the post and pass the boat's
rope round a tree. The water then rushed in, the house toppled
over, and it and its contents were swept away by the flood.</p>

<p>In a short time the tree began to shake and bend, so we knew
that it was being uprooted; therefore, letting go the rope, we launched
forth upon the seething waste of waters and were whirled away.
Onward we rushed through masses of logs, branches, the remains of
houses, and such like wreck, having to be very careful that our frail
vessel did not get upset or crushed. Twice we made for the tops of
hills that showed themselves above water, but on approaching them
we found that they had been taken possession of by wild animals.</p>

<p>Here a tiger crouched on a branch of a tree, seemingly too much
alarmed at his perilous position to molest the half-dozen deer that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
crowded timidly together right underneath his perch. Up above him
the smaller branches were stocked with monkeys, who looked very
disconsolate at their enforced imprisonment. As we swept past, the
tiger raised his head, gave a deep growl and showed his teeth, then
crouched down again as if fully aware of his helplessness, and we
had too much to think of ourselves to interfere with him.</p>

<p>Gaining the open country, the scene was one of desolation; but
the current was not so strong, so we turned round, seeing the flood
was going down, and by nightfall we had got back to where the house
had stood. Every vestige of the once pretty homestead had disappeared,
with sheep and cattle, though the fowls had managed to find
a roost on the topmost branches of some orange trees, which alone
remained to mark the spot.</p>

<p>As the moon rose, the mountaineers came down from the villages,
and, embarking on rafts and in canoes, went round the different hills,
shooting and spearing the animals that had swum there; and truly
the sight of such a hunting scene was an exciting one. Here a stout
stag, defending himself with his antlers as best he might against the
spearsmen, kept up a gallant fight till death.</p>

<p>The tiger we had seen in the morning took to swimming, and on
being wounded with a spear turned on the nearest canoe, upsetting
the hunters into the water, where a desperate encounter took place;
but he was eventually dispatched by a blow from an ax&mdash;not, however,
before he had clawed some of his pursuers most severely.</p>

<p>At daylight the water had entirely gone down, and a thick, muddy
deposit covered all the lowland, while an immense number of snakes,
scorpions, and other unpleasant creatures lay dead in all directions,
upon which and the drowned animals vultures, crows and kites were
feeding.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>There were once two kings of England at the same
time. One was Henry VI. He was the rightful
king, but a very weak and feeble man, and quite unfit to
rule his kingdom.</p>

<p>The other was young Edward, Duke of York, called
Edward IV. He was made king by some of the nobles,
who grew weary of Henry and his foolish deeds.</p>

<p>A number of the English people were faithful to King
Henry, but many others went over to King Edward's side,
and there were quarrels between the two parties, which
ended in a war. This war was called the War of the
Roses, because the followers of Henry wore a red rose as
their badge, and Edward's friends wore a white one.</p>

<p>In one battle, fought at Hexham, the White Roses beat
the Red ones, and King Henry was taken prisoner and sent
to the Tower of London. His wife, Queen Margaret, with
her little son, Prince Edward, escaped after the battle, and
hid themselves in a wild forest. As they wandered among
the trees, seeking some place where they might be safe from
their enemies, they met a band of robbers. These rough
men took away the queen's money and her jewels, tearing
her necklace from her neck, and her rings from her fingers.
Then they began to dispute as to who should have most
of the stolen goods. And while they quarrelled, Queen
Margaret took her little boy by the hand and ran away
to a thick part of the wood. There they stayed until the
angry voices of the robbers could no longer be heard, and
then, in the growing darkness, they came stealthily from
their hiding-place. They wandered on, knowing not where
to go, hoping much to meet some of their friends, and fearing
still more to be found by their enemies, the soldiers of the
White Rose. But, alas! they saw no kind face, and night
came on. Then, as they crept fearfully from tree to tree,
they met another robber.</p><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>

<p>The poor queen was much afraid that this robber, who
looked very fierce, would kill her and the prince, because
she had no riches left to give him. In despair she threw
herself upon her knees before him, and said: "My friend, this
is the son of your king. I give him into your care."</p>

<p>The robber was much surprised to see the queen and the
prince alone, with their clothes torn and stained, and their
faces white from hunger and fatigue. But he was a kindhearted
man, although his looks were rough, and before he
became a robber he had been a follower of King Henry, so
he was quite willing to do his best for the little prince. He
took the boy in his arms, and led the way to a cave in the
forest, where he lived with his wife. And in this poor
shelter, the queen and her son stayed for two days, listening
to every sound, and fearing that their enemies would find
them. On the third day, however, the friendly robber met
some of the lords of the Red Rose in the forest, and led
them to the cave. The queen and prince were overjoyed
to see their friends, and soon they escaped with them to
a place of safety.</p>

<p>Their hiding-place has been called "Queen Margaret's
Cave" ever since that time. If you go to Hexham Forest,
you will be able to see it.</p><br />

<p>In old days, books were not printed as they are now;
they were written by hand. This took a long time to
do, so there were not many books, and they were so dear
that only the rich could buy them.</p>

<p>But after a time, some clever men made a machine,
called a printing-press, which could print letters.</p>

<p>About that time, an Englishman, named William Caxton,
lived in Holland, and copied books for a great lady. He
says his hand grew tired with writing, and his eyes became
dim with much looking on white paper. So he learned
how to print, and had a printing-press made for himself,
which he brought to England. He set it up in a little
shop in London, and then he began to print books. He
printed books of all sorts&mdash;tales, and poetry, and history,
and prayers, and sermons. In the time which it had formerly
taken him to write one book, he could now print thousands.</p>

<p>All sorts of people crowded to his shop to see
Caxton's wonderful press; sometimes the king went with
his nobles. Many of them took written books with them,
which they wished to have put into print. Some people
asked Caxton to use in his books the most curious words he
could find; others wished him to print only old and homely
words. Caxton liked best the common, simple words which
men used daily in their speech.</p>

<p>Caxton did a very good thing when he brought the
printing-press to England, for, after that, books became
much cheaper, so that many people could buy them, and
learning spread in the land.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth was Queen of England it was a time
of great deeds and great men. The queen was brave
and clever herself, so she liked to have brave and clever
people around her. Great soldiers, and writers, and statesmen
went to her court; and when brave seamen came back
from their voyages to unknown lands far away, they were
invited by the queen to visit her, and tell her of all the
strange places and people they had seen. In this Elizabeth
was wise, for men did their best to show themselves worthy
of her favours.</p>

<p>Among all the great men at court, none was more
beloved than Sir Philip Sidney. He was called "the
darling of the court".</p><br />

<p class="caption">SIR PHILIP SIDNEYÂ°</p><br />

<p>At that time, there was much trouble and many wars in
some other countries, where people were fighting for the right
to worship God in their own way. Philip Sidney heard of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
these things when he was a boy in his father's house, and his
heart was stirred with pity. Later, when he was in France,
a great number of people were cruelly killed because they
would not pray in the way which the king ordered. Sidney
never forgot the dreadful sights and sounds of that sad time,
and when Queen Elizabeth sent an army to help the people
of Holland, who were fighting for their freedom, he asked for
leave to go with it. This was granted to him, and he was
made one of the leaders.</p><br />

<p class="caption">MARTYRED FOR PRAYINGÂ°</p><br />

<p>But alas! he went out to die. In one battle, a small band
of the English bravely attacked a large army of their enemies.
The horse which Sidney was riding was killed under him,
and as he mounted another, he was shot in the leg, and his
thigh-bone was broken. The horse took fright and galloped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
away from the fight, but its wounded and bleeding rider held
to his seat, and when he reached a place of safety was lifted
from his horse, and gently laid upon the ground. He was
faint from loss of blood, and in great pain, and his throat
was parched with thirst.</p>

<p>"Bring me water," said he to a friend.</p>

<p>This was not easy to do, for there was not a stream near
at hand, and in order to get to one it would be necessary
to pass where the shot from the enemy's cannons was falling
fast. But his friend was brave and went through the
danger. Then he found some water, and brought it to him.
Sidney eagerly held out his hand for the cup, and as he
was preparing to drink, another poor wounded soldier was
carried past. This man was dying; he could not speak,
but he looked with longing eyes at the water. Sir Philip
saw the look, and taking the cup from his own lips, passed
it to the soldier, saying: "Thy need is greater than mine."
The poor man quenched his thirst, and blessed him as he
died.</p>

<p>Sir Philip lived on for a few weeks, growing weaker every
day, but he never came back to his own land, and the many
friends who loved him.</p>

<p>Sidney was great in many ways; very fair to see, very wise
and good, and very clever and witty. He was one of the
bravest fighters, one of the finest poets, and one of the best
gentlemen who ever lived. He will always be remembered
for his brave deeds, and his wise sayings, but most of all do
men bless his name for this act of kindness to his poor dying
comrade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days of Queen Elizabeth, English sailors first began
to find their way across the seas to new lands, from which
they brought home many strange, and rich, and beautiful
things. The Spaniards sailed across the seas too, to fetch
gold and silver from the mines in Mexico, which belonged to
the King of Spain. Sometimes the English ships met the
Spanish ones, and robbed them of their gold, for it was
thought quite right and fair in those days to take every
chance of doing harm to the enemies of England. Of
course the Spaniards hated the English for this, and whenever
they met English ships which were weaker than theirs
they attacked them, and robbed them, killing the sailors, or
taking them prisoners.</p>

<p>Once, a small ship, called the <i>Revenge</i>, was sailing home
to England, when it met with fifty great Spanish vessels.
The captain of the <i>Revenge</i> was Sir Richard Grenville, and
he had a great many sick men on board. There was no
time to escape from the Spanish ships, which soon surrounded
the little <i>Revenge</i>. So there were only two courses which
Sir Richard could take. One was to give up his ship to
the Spaniards; the other was to fight with them till his men
were all killed, or his ship sank.</p>

<p>Some of the sailors wished him to take the first course,
but the others, and all the sick men, said: "Nay, let us fall
into the hands of God, and not into the hands of Spain."
This they said because they thought it better to die, than to
be made prisoners by the cruel Spaniards.</p>

<p>Sir Richard made up his mind to fight. It was after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
noon when the firing began, and all night long, until daylight
came, the little English ship kept the fifty Spanish vessels
at bay. Then it was found that all the powder was gone,
and all the English were dead or dying. And then only
was the flag of the <i>Revenge</i> pulled down, to show that she
surrendered to her enemies.</p>

<p>The brave Sir Richard was taken on board a Spanish
ship, where he soon died of his wounds.</p>

<p>These were his last words: "Here die I, Richard
Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind, for I have ended
my life as a good soldier ought. I have fought for my
country and my queen, for honour, and for God."</p><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a time when the people of England were
not allowed to pray to God in the way they thought
right, but were punished if they did not worship as the
king ordered. This was very hard, and when James I was
king, a little band of brave people, who found that they
could not obey the king, left their country to make a new
home across the sea, where they could be free. They are
called the "Pilgrim Fathers".</p>

<p>A hundred people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;set sail
in a little ship called the <i>Mayflower</i> for the
new world which a great explorer called Columbus had
discovered away in the west, and which we now call America.
They had a long and stormy voyage, but at last, in
mid-winter, they landed on the shores of North America,
and set up their huts.</p>

<p>At first they had much trouble, for the ground was frozen
and barren. They suffered from hunger and sickness, and
the wild Indians who lived in that land came down upon
them and tried to drive them away. But the Pilgrim
Fathers did not lose courage. They were free, and they
worked hard, and waited in patience for brighter days. By
and by other ships from England brought food to keep them
alive, and more people to help them. Then they made
friends with the Indians, and when spring came they planted
seeds and grew crops for themselves.</p>

<p>After a time many other Englishmen, who wished to be
free, followed the Pilgrim Fathers, and settled in America.
They founded the colonies of New England, which are now
a part of the United States.</p><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>In the time of James I, many of the English people
were very hardly treated because of their religion. At
last they could bear the ill-usage no longer, and they
thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen and
their eldest son.</p>

<p>Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a
cellar under the Parliament House, where James was to
meet his lords and commons on November 5; and a man
named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at the right
time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it.</p>

<p>All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that
a friend of his would be at the meeting next day. As he
did not wish him to be killed, he sent him a letter, without
signing his name, saying: "Do not go to the House, for
there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not
see who hurts them".</p>

<p>The lord who received this letter took it to the King's
Council, and when King James saw it, he guessed what the
"sudden blow" would be. Men were sent to search the
cellars, and there, on the very night before the deed was
to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time
should come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly
tortured to make him tell all he knew, but he was a brave
man, and he died without betraying his friends.</p>

<p>Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November,
bonfires have been lighted in many places in England, and
"guys" burned, to remind people how an English king
was once saved from a great danger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>When Charles I came to the throne of England, it
was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father
James I had been.</p>

<p>He did not care at all for the good of his country and
his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took
away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he
took their lives too.</p>

<p>Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long,
and soon a war began between the king and the people, who
were determined to be free.</p>

<p>At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere,
for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well
and so bravely that the people could not stand against them.
But at last a great leader arose among the people. This
leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man,
but he was just, good, and honest.</p>

<p>He saw at once that the people would never gain the
victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles,
unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for
them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men
who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent
all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in
training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers
the world has ever known. Cromwell called his men his
"lovely company", and others called them "Ironsides", for
they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten.
It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated
the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The Armada was a great fleet which the King of
Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen
Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large
and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they
came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon.</p>

<p>The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was
playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him
that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his
game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet
was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small,
but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in
the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any
ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before
the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this
way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night,
when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying
quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing
fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards
cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea,
and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they
fled. For two days the English chased the flying
Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a
storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed
on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of
the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and
dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered,
with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain
again. And so England was saved.</p>

<p>Lathom House is an old English castle. When
the war broke out between King Charles I and his
people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle,
went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at
home with her children, with a small band of armed men
to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the
people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the
army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the
castle at once.</p>

<p>But the Countess was a brave woman. She replied
that she would rather set fire to the castle, and die with
her children in the flames, than give it up to the king's
enemies.</p>

<p>Then began a fight which lasted many weeks. The
large army outside the walls did their best to break a
way in, but the small company inside defended the castle
bravely. At last the leader of the besiegers brought a
strong new gun, and it was soon seen that this would break
down the walls. Then one night the Countess sent out a
party of brave men, who seized the new gun and brought it
into the castle, and so the worst danger was over. Soon
afterwards Prince Rupert, one of the king's generals, came
with an army to help the Countess, and Lathom House was
saved.</p>

<p>The prince drove away the soldiers of the people, and
took from them twenty-two banners, which he sent as a
present to the Countess, to show how much he admired her
bravery.</p>

<p>Many years ago there dwelt in the forest of
Inglewood, in the North country, three yeomen,
who had been outlawed for killing the king's deer.
They were all famous archers, and defying every
attempt to arrest them, they lived a free life in the
green wood. But finally growing tired of this
dangerous life, they went to the king to sue for
pardon. It happened that the king's archers were
exhibiting their skill by shooting at marks, which
none of them missed. But one of the outlawed
archers, named Cloudesly, made light of their skill,
and told the king that he could do better than any
of his archers had done. "To prove the truth of
my claim," he said, "I will take my son, who is
only seven years old and is dear to me, and I will
tie him to a stake, and lay an apple on his head,
and go six score paces from him, and with a broad
arrow I will cleave the apple in two."</p>

<p>"Now listen," said the king, "and do as you say;
but if you touch his head, or his dress, you shall
be hanged all three."</p>

<p>"I will not go back on my word," said Cloudesly;
and driving a stake into the ground, he bound
thereto his little son, and placed an apple on his
head. All being ready he bent his bow, the arrow
flew from the string, the apple was cleft in twain,
and the child was unhurt. The king thereupon
pardoned the three outlaws and received them into
his service.</p><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was a favourite courtier of
Queen Elizabeth. An old story tells us of the way he
won her favour.</p>

<p>One day, as the queen and her ladies were out walking,
dressed in fine robes of silk and lace, they came to a miry
puddle in the road. The queen stopped in dismay, for she
did not like getting her feet wet and dirty. As she was
thinking how best to step through the mud, a young man
in a rich suit came along the road.</p>

<p>Directly he saw the queen, young Raleigh, for it was he,
sprang forward, and, taking off his velvet cloak, spread it
over the mud for her to walk upon.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was much pleased; she rewarded Raleigh with
a post in the palace. There, one day, he wrote upon
a window which he knew the queen would pass: "Fain
would I climb, but that I fear to fall". When Elizabeth
saw this, she added these words: "If thy heart fail thee,
climb not at all". However, Raleigh did climb very soon
to a high place, for he was clever and brave as well as
polite, and he served the queen in many ways.</p>

<p>It is said that his ships first brought potatoes and tobacco
to England from America, and that he was the first man in
this country to smoke. One day, a servant brought a jug of
ale into the room where Raleigh was sitting and smoking.
The man was much alarmed to see smoke coming from his
master's mouth, and he quickly emptied the jug of ale over
Raleigh's head, to put out the fire which he thought was
burning within him.</p><br />
